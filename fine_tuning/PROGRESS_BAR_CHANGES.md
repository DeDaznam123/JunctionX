# Progress Bar Enhancement - Change Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. train_model.py
**Added tqdm progress bars to the training process with the following enhancements:**

#### Imports
- Added `TrainerCallback` to the transformers imports
- Added `from tqdm.auto import tqdm` for progress bar functionality

#### New ProgressCallback Class
Created a custom callback class that provides:
- **Training Progress Bar**: Shows overall progress across all training steps
  - Displays total steps completed
  - Shows current loss and learning rate
  - Dynamic column width for better display
  
- **Epoch Progress Bar**: Shows progress within each epoch
  - Displays current epoch number (e.g., "Epoch 1/3")
  - Updates per training step
  - Automatically closes at epoch end

#### Features:
- **Dual Progress Bars**: One for overall training, one for current epoch
- **Real-time Metrics**: Loss and learning rate displayed in progress bar
- **Clean Display**: Bars position themselves correctly and clean up automatically
- **Evaluation Messages**: Logs when evaluation starts at each checkpoint

#### Integration
- Updated `TrainingArguments` with:
  - `disable_tqdm=False` to ensure progress bars are enabled
  - `logging_first_step=True` for immediate feedback
  
- Added `callbacks=[progress_callback]` to the Trainer initialization

### 2. evaluate_model.py
**Added tqdm progress bar to the prediction/evaluation process:**

#### Changes:
- Added `from tqdm.auto import tqdm` import
- Wrapped the prediction loop with tqdm progress bar
- Shows progress during batch prediction with:
  - Description: "Predicting"
  - Unit: "batch"
  - Real-time batch count

## Visual Output

During training, you'll now see:
```
Training Progress:  45%|████████████              | 450/1000 [10:30<12:15, loss=0.2341, lr=1.5e-05]
Epoch 2/3:  67%|████████████████▎         | 201/300 [04:43<02:19]
```

During evaluation, you'll see:
```
Predicting: 100%|████████████████████████████| 32/32 [00:15<00:00, 2.13batch/s]
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Clear visual feedback on training progress
2. **Time Estimates**: Automatic ETA calculations for completion
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time loss and learning rate visibility
4. **Non-intrusive**: Progress bars clean up automatically after completion
5. **Informative**: Shows both step-level and epoch-level progress

## Usage

No changes required to existing usage! Simply run the training as before:

```bash
python train_model.py --data_dir ./data --output_dir ./outputs
```

The progress bars will automatically appear and update during training and evaluation.

## Technical Details

- Uses `tqdm.auto` for automatic detection of notebook vs terminal environment
- Progress bars use `dynamic_ncols=True` for responsive width adjustment
- Positions are set to avoid overlap (position=0 for training, position=1 for epoch)
- `leave=True` for training bar (persists), `leave=False` for epoch bar (temporary)
- All bars properly cleaned up on training completion or interruption
